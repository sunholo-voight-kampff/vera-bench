## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.11] - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- Aver test-wrapper harness emits `Console.print("{<call>}")` (string
  interpolation) instead of `Console.print(<call>)`. Aver 0.16
  ("Anneal") tightens `Console.print` to require `String` — the
  previous form silently coerced `Int`, `Bool`, `List<T>`, etc. and
  was a typecheck error from 0.16 onwards. Interpolation predates the
  breaking change by many versions, so the same wrapper works on
  Aver 0.10–0.15 and on 0.16+ (#65).
- All 56 canonical Aver baseline solutions migrated from
  `Console.print(EXPR)` to `Console.print("{EXPR}")`. Mechanical and
  shape-preserving for nested expressions and string arguments.
- 9 baselines whose `main()` printed only a subset of their
  problem-JSON `test_cases` had `main()` regenerated to print every
  test case. This was a pre-existing coverage gap that surfaces only
  after the interpolation migration brings them past `aver check`.

### Added

- 3 Aver baselines restored: `VB_T2_011_starts_with_prefix.av`,
  `VB_T2_012_ends_with_suffix.av`, `VB_T2_013_get_char_code.av`.
  Originally added in v0.0.9 then removed during PR #57 review
  because the Aver stdlib didn't expose `starts_with` / `ends_with` /
  `char_at` at the time. Aver 0.15+ has `String.startsWith`,
  `String.endsWith`, `String.charAt`, and `Char.toCode`, so the three
  baselines are reinstated.

### Compatibility note

Aver scoring on Aver 0.16+ requires v0.0.11 — without this release,
every injected `aver run` crashes at typecheck and `run_correct = 0%`
across the board. For Aver 0.10–0.15, scoring may differ slightly
between v0.0.10 and v0.0.11 result files for the same model on the
same problems:

- The 9 coverage-gap fixes mean `run_correct` is now measured against
  the full set of test cases declared in each problem JSON, rather
  than the partial set the baseline `main()` happened to print. Some
  problems that previously appeared to pass on a partial check may
  now fail on the full check, and vice versa.
- The 3 restored T2 baselines (T2-011/012/013) now contribute to the
  Aver baseline `run_correct` denominator (60 / 60), where they
  previously contributed nothing (no canonical solution available, so
  pre-#65 Aver baselines reported 60 problems with 3 effectively
  excluded from scoring).

The Aver baseline rises to 100% check@1, 100% run_correct against
Aver 0.15.2 with this PR; the previous baseline was 95%/73% on the
same compiler. The lift is real (not a definitional artefact) but
result files are tagged with `bench_version` so cross-version
comparisons can detect this boundary.

Vera, Vera spec-from-NL, Python, and TypeScript scoring is
unaffected.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Aver evaluation harness strips module-header `effects [...]` declarations
  before injecting the test main (#62). The injected main needs
  `! [Console.print]`, which would violate any narrower boundary the LLM
  declared (including the common `effects []` for "pure" modules) once
  Aver 0.13 ships and enforces the boundary as a hard type error.
- The strip is window-scoped (only fires inside the module-header block,
  not on `effects [...]`-shaped lines elsewhere), tolerates arbitrary
  whitespace between `effects` and `[`, and tolerates trailing line
  comments after the closing `]`.

### Compatibility note

This is a methodology change for Aver scoring: the same LLM output now
goes through an extra strip pass before reaching the compiler. On Aver
0.12 and earlier the strip is a no-op (LLMs don't emit module-level
`effects [...]` because the docs don't yet describe it), so today's
Aver scores are byte-identical to v0.0.9. Once Aver 0.13 ships and the
boundary becomes part of the doc nudge to models, Aver `run_correct`
rates from v0.0.10 onwards will diverge from any v0.0.9-tagged Aver
results run against Aver 0.13+ — the strip will activate on a measurable
fraction of generations and prevent the underdeclared-effects type
error. Result files are tagged with `bench_version` so cross-version
comparisons can detect this boundary.

Vera, Vera spec-from-NL, Python, and TypeScript scoring is unaffected.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Report shows separate "All Tiers (T1–T5)" and "Comparable (T1–T4)" summary
  sections for cross-language comparison (#50)
- `exclude_tiers` parameter on `compute_metrics()` for tier-filtered aggregation
- Methodology note explaining why T5 is reported separately
- 10 new problems: 5 Tier 2 (VB-T2-011 through VB-T2-015) and 5 Tier 3
  (VB-T3-011 through VB-T3-015), bringing total to 60 problems across 5 tiers
- Test cases for VB-T2-004 (is_empty_string) and VB-T2-005 (contains_substring)
- All new problems have testable signatures (primitive inputs/outputs) so
  `run_correct` can be evaluated via `vera run --fn`
- New T3 problems use Int-only signatures with internal ADT construction,
  testing pattern matching without requiring ADT CLI argument support
- Canonical solutions for all new problems in Vera, Python, TypeScript, and Aver

### Changed

- Comparable section is suppressed when no T1–T4 problems are present

## [0.0.8] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Aver language support: generation, checking, execution, and fix-from-error
- `description_neutral` field on all 50 problem JSONs for language-neutral prompts
- Aver baseline runner (`vera-bench baselines --language aver`)

### Changed

- Python and TypeScript prompts now use `description_neutral` instead of
  Vera-flavoured `description`. This improves fairness for non-Vera languages
  but means results are not directly comparable to v0.0.7 runs which used
  Vera-specific descriptions.
- README: added Aver as a comparison language, updated CLI examples
- CLAUDE.md: added `description_neutral` documentation, comparison language guide, Aver section, Tier 5 caveat
- DESIGN.md: added `description_neutral` rationale, zero-training-data comparison languages, Tier 5 methodology note
- CONTRIBUTING.md: added "Adding a New Comparison Language" guide with step-by-step checklist
- ROADMAP.md: added Aver milestone, MoonBit (#49), Tier 5 methodology (#50), timing (#51) items

## [0.0.7] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- Moonshot (Kimi) provider support — OpenAI-compatible API via `moonshot/*` model prefix
- `MoonshotClient` in models.py using `api.moonshot.ai/v1` base URL
- `scripts/run_full_benchmark.py` — run all 6 benchmark targets with one command
  (interactive mode with provider/model/key menus, or autonomous via CLI args)
- Secure API key input via `getpass` in interactive mode

## [0.0.6] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Bench and vera compiler versions in JSONL filenames and result records (#20)
- `VeraRunner.version()` method to query vera compiler version
- 52 new tests across 4 new test files (test_cli.py, test_models.py,
  test_validate_integration.py, test_vera_runner_integration.py)
  plus expanded existing tests

### Changed

- CI coverage threshold raised from 35% to 80%
- Test coverage: 66% → 83% (324 → 376 tests)

## [0.0.5] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Strengthened problem descriptions for De Bruijn slot ordering (issue #13):
  VB-T4-002 (GCD), VB-T4-004 (power), VB-T5-003 (safe_div) now explicitly
  state which `@Type.N` maps to which parameter in the description text
- Strengthened postconditions to catch logic bugs (issue #14):
  - VB-T4-002 (GCD): added `@Nat.result <= @Nat.1 || @Nat.0 > 0`
  - VB-T4-005 (sum_to_n): added `@Nat.result >= @Nat.0`
  - VB-T4-008 (multiply): added `@Nat.result == @Nat.1 * @Nat.0`
  - VB-T4-010 (div_natural): added `@Nat.result * @Nat.0 <= @Nat.1`
  - VB-T5-001 (counter): `true` → `@Int.result == 3`
  - VB-T5-006 (state_double): `true` → `@Int.result == @Int.0 * 2`
  - VB-T5-009 (state_max): `true` → `@Int.result == @Nat.0`
- SKILL.md now fetched from veralang.dev at runtime (no local cache)

## [0.0.4] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- TypeScript baseline runner (`vera-bench baselines --language typescript`)
- TypeScript LLM generation (`vera-bench run --model MODEL --language typescript`)
- TypeScript prompt builder with automatic snake_case → camelCase conversion
- TypeScript code evaluation via `npx tsx` (Node.js 22+)
- Node.js 22 added to CI test job for TypeScript support
- `_snake_to_camel()` utility for entry_point name conversion

### Changed

- `--language` flag now accepts `vera`, `python`, or `typescript`
- `--language` warning for Vera-specific flags generalised to all non-Vera languages
- `_find_baseline_file()` now uses language-specific file extensions

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- `--language python` flag on `vera-bench run` for cross-language LLM comparison
- Python prompt builder (`build_python_prompt`) — minimal prompt without SKILL.md or contracts
- Python code evaluation via subprocess with test wrapper

- Vera-specific metrics (verify@1, fix@1) hidden for Python runs
- Warning when Vera-only flags are used with `--language python`
- CHANGELOG.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md
- CI and Codecov badges in README

### Security

- Python subprocess runs with `cwd=work_dir` and API keys stripped from env
- SyntaxError/ImportError/NameError in generated Python sets `check_pass=False`

- `baseline_runner.py` — subprocess-based Python execution with generated test wrappers
- Cross-language comparison in `vera-bench report` (Vera results alongside Python baselines)
- Bool string normalisation for test cases (`"true"`/`"false"` → Python `True`/`False`)

### Fixed

- `run_correct` reporting: shows `-` instead of `0%` when no test cases exist (Tier 2/3)
- `check_rate` type annotation corrected to `float | None`

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- LLM runner harness — `vera-bench run --model MODEL` works end-to-end
