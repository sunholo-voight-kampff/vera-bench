### AILANG: AI-designed language, AI-authored solutions (added in this fork)

[AILANG](https://ailang.sunholo.com/) is unique among VeraBench's target languages: **the language itself is 100% AI-authored, by a multi-model team**. Vera, Python, TypeScript, and Aver are human-designed. AILANG's compiler, type system, effect rows, stdlib, and teaching prompt were collaboratively authored by Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini models during AILANG's development.

The reference solutions in `solutions/ailang/` are AI-authored too — written by **Claude Opus 4.7 (effort: high), 2026-05-21**, given AILANG's own teaching prompt as the language reference, with iteration on the harness's check/run feedback (similar to a real coding-agent loop, not a single-shot LLM call).

| Mode | Author model + date | check@1 | run_correct@1 |
|------|---------------------|---------|---------------|
| AI-authored + iterated | **Claude Opus 4.7 (high), 2026-05-21** | **100% (36/36)** | **100% (36/36)** |
| **LLM single-shot** | **Claude Haiku 4.5, 2026-05-21** | **90%** | **97%** |
| **LLM single-shot** | **Kimi K2.5 (via OpenRouter), 2026-05-21** | **77%** | **97%** |

**The full-circle finding**: AI designs the language, AI writes the code in it, the result passes 97–100% of solvable VeraBench problems across multiple model tiers. A **cheap** LLM (Claude Haiku 4.5) hits 97% run_correct on AILANG — matching what published Vera/Python/TypeScript results show only flagship LLMs achieve. Kimi K2.5 on AILANG hits 97% too vs its published 100% on Vera (3pp gap; same model, different language). See [AILANG_RESULTS.md](./AILANG_RESULTS.md) for the full methodology, per-tier breakdown, and head-to-head comparison.

### Key findings

**Kimi K2.5 writes perfect Vera code** — 100% run_correct on both full-spec and spec-from-NL modes, beating Python (86%) and TypeScript (91%). This is the first model where Vera is the best language across the board.

**Three models beat TypeScript on Vera.** Kimi K2.5 (+9pp), Kimi K2 Turbo (+4pp), and in our [initial v0.0.4 benchmark](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench/releases/tag/v0.0.4) Claude Sonnet 4 also beat TypeScript (83% vs 79%). The pattern is consistent across providers: Vera's mandatory contracts and typed slot references provide enough structure to compensate for zero training data.

**Python remains the strongest target for most models.** Claude, OpenAI, and Moonshot all hit 86–96% run_correct on Python. The gap between Python and Vera varies from 0pp (Kimi K2.5 spec-from-NL: both 100%) to 17pp (Claude Sonnet 4: 96% vs 79%).

**Spec-from-NL is the harder test.** When models must infer their own contracts from natural language, performance drops for most models — GPT-4.1 falls from 91% to 50%. But Kimi K2.5 holds at 100%, suggesting it has internalised Vera's type system well enough to author specifications from scratch.

> **Note:** These are single-run results. LLM outputs are non-deterministic — individual problems can flip between pass and fail across runs. The v0.0.4 Claude Sonnet 4 result (83% Vera, 79% TypeScript) shifted to 79%/88% in the v0.0.7 re-run, illustrating this variance. Stable rates will require [pass@k](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374) evaluation with multiple trials. This is early days — 50 problems, one run per model.

### Why this matters: zero training data

No LLM has ever been trained on Vera. There are no Vera examples on GitHub, no Stack Overflow answers, no tutorials — the language was created after these models' training cutoffs. Every token of Vera code in these results was written by a model that learned the language entirely from a single document ([SKILL.md](https://veralang.dev/SKILL.md)) provided in the prompt at evaluation time.

Python and TypeScript, by contrast, are among the most heavily represented languages in LLM training data — billions of lines of code, documentation, and Q&A. The fact that multiple models write *better* Vera than TypeScript despite this asymmetry suggests that language design matters more than training data volume. Vera's mandatory contracts, typed slot references, and explicit effect annotations give models enough structural guardrails that in-context instruction alone is sufficient — no pre-training required.

## Overview

VeraBench measures whether LLMs write better code in a language designed for them. Vera uses typed slot references instead of variable names, mandatory contracts, and explicit algebraic effects — all features that should make LLM-generated code more verifiable.

The benchmark covers five difficulty tiers:

| Tier | Focus | What it tests |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Pure arithmetic | Basic syntax, `@T.n` slot references, simple contracts |
| 2 | String & array ops | Built-in function discovery (`domain_verb` naming) |
| 3 | ADTs & match | Data type definition, De Bruijn indices in match arms |
| 4 | Recursion & termination | `decreases` clauses, Z3 verification |
| 5 | Multi-function & effects | IO, State, Exn, effect propagation across functions |

For each problem, we measure:

- **check@1** — Does the code pass `vera check` on first attempt?
- **verify@1** — Does it pass `vera verify` (Z3 contract verification)?
- **fix@1** — Given the error message, can the model fix it in one turn?
- **run_correct** — Does execution produce the correct output?

The same problems are also run in Python, TypeScript, and [Aver](https://github.com/jasisz/aver) as baselines. Aver is a Haskell-inspired language with zero LLM training data, providing a second data point alongside Vera for the zero-training-data thesis.

> **Cross-language comparison:** For cross-language headline rates, use the T1–T4 aggregate. Tier 5 tests Vera's algebraic effect handlers, which other languages solve with fundamentally different native idioms. See [#50](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench/issues/50).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* Git
* Node.js 22+ *(optional, for TypeScript baselines and generation)*
* [Aver](https://github.com/jasisz/aver) *(optional, for Aver baselines and generation)*

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench.git
cd vera-bench
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[llm]"
```

The `[llm]` extra installs the Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs. Use `pip install -e .` if you only need validation (no model evaluation).

### Install the Vera compiler

The `vera` command must be available on `$PATH`. Install it anywhere into the same environment, either from a local clone,

```bash
pip install -e /path/to/vera          
```

or directly from GitHub.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aallan/vera.git   
```
Afterwards you should be able to print the Vera version from the terminal,

```bash
vera version   
```

this should return v0.0.108 or later.

## Quick start

Once Vera is installed you can run the benchmark from the terminal,

```bash
# Validate all 60 problems and canonical solutions
vera-bench validate

# Run benchmark against a model
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Run a single tier
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --tier 1

# Run a single problem
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --problem VB-T1-001

# Spec-from-NL mode (agent writes its own contracts)
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --mode spec-from-nl

# Ask the same model to write Python, TypeScript, or Aver for comparison
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --language python
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --language typescript
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --language aver

# Run canonical baselines as a reference
vera-bench baselines
vera-bench baselines --language typescript
vera-bench baselines --language aver

# Generate a combined report
vera-bench report results/

# Or run the full benchmark suite (all 8 targets) with one command
python scripts/run_full_benchmark.py
```

Supported providers: [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com) (Claude), [OpenAI](https://openai.com) (GPT), and [Kimi](https://platform.kimi.ai) (Moonshot). Set the appropriate API key environment variable (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`).

The Vera language reference ([SKILL.md](https://veralang.dev/SKILL.md)) is fetched automatically from veralang.dev when running Vera benchmarks. To use a local copy instead (e.g., for testing unreleased language features):

```bash
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514 --skill-md /path/to/SKILL.md
```

## Report generation

Running `vera-bench report results/` generates `results/summary.md` with a summary table, per-tier breakdowns, and per-problem detail. Each `vera-bench run` writes incremental JSONL results (one line per problem attempt), so partial runs are resumable and always reportable. Results files are in `.gitignore` — they are generated artifacts, not checked in.

## Prior art

VeraBench is inspired by:

- [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) — 164 Python function completion problems
- [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp) — 974 Python problems from natural language
- [DafnyBench](https://github.com/sun-wendy/DafnyBench) — 782 Dafny verification annotation problems

DafnyBench demonstrated that tracking verification success rates over time attracts genuine research attention — success rates went from 68% to 96% across model generations in under two years. VeraBench aims to create the same longitudinal story for a language designed from scratch for LLM code generation.
